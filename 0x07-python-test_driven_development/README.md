# Test Driven Development

In this project I learnt:
* What an interactive test is
* Why testing is important
* How I can write my tests in the various docstrings in a module
* How to use the unittest and doctest modules
* How to find edge cases for tests
* **Most Important** No test is exhausive

***NB***
Tests are located in the `tests/` directory
